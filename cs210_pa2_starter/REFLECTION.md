# Reflection Questions
### 1. For every function you wrote (TODO 1 to 19), explain in your own words what it does and give its time complexity in terms of n, the number of scenes. One short paragraph each.


### 2. Why does each scene allocate exactly numChoices slots instead of declaring Scene<T>* choices[3]? What does an ending hold in choices_, and why?


### 3. Walk through your Scene destructor. What gets deleted, and in what order? What would go wrong if choices_ were deleted first?


### 4. Show the path greedy took and the path optimal took on your story, with the loot for each. Explain why greedy lost. If greedy did not lose, change your story until it does, and explain what you changed.


### 5. bestLoot tries every path, yet it runs in O(n) time. Explain why it is not exponential, using what you know about paths and leaves in a tree.


### 6. Which List methods does your game use, and why? What does one search cost as the bag grows?
